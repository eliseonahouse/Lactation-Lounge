			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
				<p>The Mothers’ Milk Bank is one of the milk banks who are members of the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA). HMBANA is a multidisciplinary group of health care providers that promotes, protects, and supports donor milk banking. It is the only professional membership association for milk banks in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and sets the standards and guidelines for donor milk banking in those areas.
				</p>
				<p>The Mothers’ Milk Bank of Florida is a 501c(3) charitable organization. Our mission is to improve health and promote healing by collecting, processing, and distributing pasteurized donor human milk to vulnerable babies when milk from the baby’s own mother is not available.
				</p>
				<p>The staff and volunteers of Mothers’ Milk Bank of Florida (MMBFL) work toward the goal of ensuring the availability of safe, pasteurized donor human milk for all of Florida’s vulnerable infants.</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
				<p>Mothers’ Milk Bank of Florida was established in 2008 as a 501c(3) charitable organization. We believe in a world where all infants have access to human milk through support of breastfeeding and use of donor human milk.
				</p>
				<p>Neonatologists emphasize that human milk fights infection while providing ideal nutrition. It is also a key factor in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease that attacks the intestinal tract, damaging or destroying it, and requiring surgery to repair or remove the intestines.  Human milk makes a huge difference in how well babies do after birth and benefits them in both nutrition and immunity.
